        Legal Aspects of Refund Policies
      </h2>
      <p className="text-[18px] mb-4" >
        Understanding the legal framework surrounding refund policies is
        crucial for both businesses and consumers. In many jurisdictions, laws
        mandate specific refund rights for consumers, such as the right to a
        refund for faulty goods or services. For example, the European Unionâ€™s
        Consumer Rights Directive provides a 14-day withdrawal period for
        distance and off-premises contracts.
