            Legal Aspects of Refund Policies
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base md:text-[18px] mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Understanding the legal framework surrounding refund policies is
            crucial for both businesses and consumers. In many jurisdictions, laws
            mandate specific refund rights for consumers, such as the right to a
            refund for faulty goods or services. For example, the European Unionâ€™s
            Consumer Rights Directive provides a 14-day withdrawal period for
            distance and off-premises contracts.
